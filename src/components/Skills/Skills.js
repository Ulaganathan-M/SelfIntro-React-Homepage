                If you are changing careers or industries and do not have extensive professional experience, you might decide to feature them at the top of your resume. This type of resume is called a functional resume.

                To include skills on a functional resume, you should create skill sections that list your successes with key skills relevant to the position for which youâ€™re applying. Any professional experience you do have should go below your skills section.

                Here is an example of how to list skills on a functional resume.
                Skills
